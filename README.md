# Contributing #

*Please, this cannot be stressed enough. MAKE SURE THE CODE WORKS BEFORE YOU COMMIT!* 
- Fork/Clone the repository. 
- Add your changes as desired, make sure *they work!*
- Once you have made your changes, and they are proven to be working, commit to the *Master* branch. 
- *Initial testing of the code on the server is imminent, if there is an issue with the testing, revert your commit.* 
- If testing does not succeed, undo the commit and fix any errors necessary. 
- Once fixed, rinse and repeat the 3rd step. 

*Note: When you run the batch files, and they make "changes" that need committed. Do NOT discard them, push them to master as the respective update. (e.g "UberDOG Commit #")*
